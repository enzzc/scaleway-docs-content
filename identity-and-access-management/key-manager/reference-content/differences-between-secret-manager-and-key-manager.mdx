Secret Manager and Key Manager are both security-focused products aiming
to help you protect your data and improve the security of your
infrastructure.
The difference between them is not always clear, and it is natural
to ask which one you need according to your use-case.

This document helps you answer that question.


## Secret Manager

The Secret Manager stores various secrets that your applications wants to
access at some point. For example, when your application needs to call
an external API service or connect to a database, it fetches the API token
or the credentials from the Secret Manager before proceeding.

Secrets can be pretty much everything you want: API tokens,
credentials to connect to a database, sensible data.
There is no limitation, if not the size of the secrets.


## Key Manager

In contrast, Key Manager only stores cryptographic keys.

At first, the Key Manager seems to be just a restricted version of
the Secret Manager, only for keys.
It is indeed true that the Secret Manager could also store cryptographic keys
and hand over the keys to applications that need to perform cryptographic operations.

However, this approach is full of pitfalls and can lead to serious security problems:

 - Inadvertently storing the keys in plaintext, or exposing them (<i>e.g.</i>, in logs)
 - Incorrect (re-)use of key: your application would be responsible to use the key correctly,
   which is harder than it looks.
 - Not disposing the key properly after use (<i>e.g.</i>, letting it reside in swap disk)

They are typical key management problems, and the Secret Manager does not solve them
effectively, hence the need of the Key Manager.

The Key Manager simply does **not** gives you any key.
All keys residing in the Key Manager never (and never will) leave the Key Manager, since
there is no way to extract them by design.

Instead of grabbing a key to perform operations with it, your application
asks the Key Manager to perform encryption (or decryption) on the supplied plaintext
(or ciphertext). Thus your application is no longer responsible of managing the keys
and using them properly, because the Key Manager takes care of it.

Last, but not least, the Key Manager provides another way of authorizing some actions.
You might want to authorize some principals to only encrypt data, and other
principals to only decrypt data.

For example, imagine an application that receives
some sensible health data that needs to be encrypted before being inserted into
a database. Such an application would have the privilege to ask the Key Manager
encryption operations, but not decryption opeartions, so it cannot read sensible
data already stored.

This is not possible to achieve with Secret Manager, since both writing and reading
applications would need at least the privilege of reading the key from the Secret Manager,
which is sufficient to both encrypt and decrypt the data.


## How Secret Manager and Key Manager are related

The Secret Manager does not store your secrets in plaintext.
When you create a new secret version, the Secret Manager asks the Key Manager
to encrypt your secret content before storing it.

When you request an access to a secret version, the Secret Manager
does the reverse operation: it asks the Key Manager to decrypt
your ciphertext secret content before returning it to you.

At no moment the Secret Manager needs reading the key residing in the
Key Manager to protect your secrets.

When you use the Secret Manager with Scaleway-managed keys,
(which is the only mode supported for now) you are not charged
for the underlying Key Manager's keys and operations.
