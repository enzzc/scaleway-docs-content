Secret Manager and Key Manager are both security-focused products aiming
to help you protect your data and improve the security of your
infrastructure.
The difference between them is not always clear, and you may be
unsure which one is most appropriate for your use-case.

This document helps you answer that question.


## Secret Manager

Secret Manager stores various secrets that your applications needs to
access at some point. For example, when your application needs to call
an external API service or connect to a database, it fetches the API token
or the credentials from the Secret Manager before proceeding.

Secrets can be largely anything you want: API tokens,
credentials to connect to a database or simply sensitive data.
There are no limits, other than to the size of the secrets.


## Key Manager

In contrast, Key Manager only stores cryptographic keys.

At first, the Key Manager may seem to be just a limited version of
the Secret Manager, for keys only.
It is indeed true that the Secret Manager could also store cryptographic keys
and hand them over to applications that need to perform cryptographic operations.

However, this approach is full of pitfalls and can lead to serious security problems:

 - Inadvertently storing the keys in plaintext, or exposing them (e.g. in logs)
 - Incorrect (re-)use of key: your application would be responsible for using the key correctly,
   which is harder than it first seems.
 - Not disposing of the key properly after use (e.g. letting it reside in swap disk)

These are typical key management problems, which are not effectively solved by Secret Manager
, hence the need for Key Manager.

Key Manager does **not** simply give you any requested key.
All keys residing in Key Manager never (and never will) leave Key Manager, since
there is no way to extract them by design.

Since you cannot have the key, Key Manager performs the cryptographic operations
for you: your application supplies the plaintext to be encrypted, or
the ciphertext to be decrypted. That means your application is no longer
responsible for managing the keys and using them properly: Key Manager takes care of this.

Last, but not least, Key Manager provides another way of authorizing certain actions.
You might want to authorize some principals only to encrypt data, and others
only to decrypt data.

For example, imagine an application that receives
sensitive health data that needs to be encrypted before being inserted into
a database. Such an application would be able to ask the Key Manager
to carry out encryption operations, but not decryption operations, so it cannot read the sensitive
data already stored.

This is not possible to achieve with Secret Manager, since both writing and reading
applications would need at least the privilege of reading the key from the Secret Manager,
which is sufficient to both encrypt and decrypt the data.


## Conclusion

Cryptographic keys are secrets that need special care, and Key Manager
is an effective tool to help you manage them securely,
allowing your application to offload all sensitive cryptographic
operations and keep keys out-of-band for extra security.
